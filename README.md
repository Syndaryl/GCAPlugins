# GCAPlugins
A project with plugins for GCA5 - exporting, printing, etc.

Currently, the only plugin exports the character to a text format suitable for pasting into a MediaWiki site. It has some configuration options. Uses no special extensions or plugins on Mediawiki.

DLL and configuration XML goes into your Documents\GURPS Character Assistant 5\plugins\Somesubfolder\ folder. Somesubfolder is arbitrary, up to you.
